## Sprint 1 Deliverables

* `pom.xml`: Maven configuration with all dependencies (Spark, Gson, Logback) and security vulnerability mitigations (Jetty version management).
* `src/main/java/com/rafael/collectibles/Main.java`: Main API source code, including all user routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS).
* `README.md`: This file.
* `DECISIONS.md`: The shared log for key technical decisions.
